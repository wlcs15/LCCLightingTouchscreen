# LCC Lighting Touchscreen Controller

An ESP32-S3–based LCC/OpenLCB lighting scene controller with a touch LCD user interface for model railroad layout lighting control. Designed specifically to interface with my [LCC Lighting Controller](https://github.com/vsi5004/LCCLightingController)

**Tag `v1.0.0` (pushed 26-Aug-2026).** First `vN.N` SNIP tag on this tree (also `CLS_Still_Works!!`). No lighting board was on the bus this session; do not flash A5.04 (that is LCCControlPanelTouchscreen). Identify USB by `/dev/serial/by-id/`, not `ttyACM*` order. RR-CirKits gateway: `usb-STMicroelectronics_STM32_Virtual_ComPort_209737A73931-if00` (`0483:5740`, JMRI CAN @ 57600 — do not flash). Mega: `usb-Arduino__www.arduino.cc__0042_85036313230351A00280-if00` (`2341:0042`). This S3 panel: Espressif `303a:1001` `usb-Espressif_USB_JTAG_serial_debug_unit_*` — hold BOOT and replug native USB-C if it drops. Two CH340 D1 R32 boards share VID:PID; use MAC.

## Overview

![Photo of mounted touchscreen on layout](./docs/img/touchsreen_photo.jpg)
This device connects to an LCC (Layout Command Control) / OpenLCB CAN bus and sends RGBW lighting commands to follower lighting controller boards. It provides an intuitive touch interface for:

- **Manual Control** — Real-time RGBW + brightness adjustment via sliders
- **Scene Management** — Save, load, edit, reorder, and delete lighting presets
- **Configurable Fades** — Linear transitions up to 5 minutes with visual progress
- **Power Saving** — Automatic backlight timeout with touch-to-wake

The controller does **not** drive LEDs directly; it acts as a command station sending events to downstream lighting nodes.

## SD Card Setup

The device reads configuration and scenes from the SD card root.

### Quick Start

The `sdcard/` directory in this repository contains template files that you can copy directly to your SD card:

1. Format your SD card as FAT32
2. Copy all files from the `sdcard/` folder to the root of your SD card
3. Edit `nodeid.txt` with your unique LCC node ID (see below)
4. Optionally customize `scenes.json` with your preferred lighting presets

### File Reference

#### `nodeid.txt`

Plain text file containing the 48-bit LCC node ID in dotted hex format:

```
05.01.01.01.9F.60.00
```

**Format:** 7 groups of 2 hex digits separated by periods (case insensitive, no spaces).

**Generating a Unique Node ID:**
- Use the [OpenLCB Node ID Registry](https://registry.openlcb.org/)
- Ensure uniqueness on your LCC network

**Compile-Time Default:**

The firmware includes a default node ID (`LCC_DEFAULT_NODE_ID` in `main/app/lcc_node.cpp`) that is used only if `nodeid.txt` is missing from the SD card. For production use, always create a `nodeid.txt` file with your unique node ID.

See [FLASHING.md - Node ID Configuration](FLASHING.md#node-id-configuration) for details on customizing the compiled default.

#### `openmrn_config`

Binary file automatically created by OpenMRN. Stores LCC configuration data:

**User Info (ACDI)**
- User Name — Node name shown in LCC tools (e.g., JMRI)
- User Description — Node description

**Startup Behavior**
- Auto-Apply First Scene on Boot — Enable (1) or disable (0)
- Auto-Apply Transition Duration — Fade time in seconds (0-300)
- Screen Backlight Timeout — Seconds before screen sleeps (0 = disabled, 10-3600)

**Lighting Configuration**
- Base Event ID — 8-byte event ID base for lighting commands

All settings are configurable via any LCC configuration tool (JMRI, etc.).

#### `scenes.json`

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "scenes": [
    { "name": "sunrise", "brightness": 180, "r": 255, "g": 120, "b": 40, "w": 0 },
    { "name": "night",   "brightness": 30,  "r": 10,  "g": 10,  "b": 40, "w": 0 }
  ]
}
```

#### `splash.jpg`

## LCC Event Model

Events are transmitted to control downstream RGBW lighting nodes using a 
**Duration-Triggered Fade Protocol**. The touchscreen sends target values and 
transition duration; LED controllers perform local high-fidelity fading at ~60fps.

### Event ID Format

```
05.01.01.01.9F.60.0X.VV
                  │  └── Value (0-255)
                  └───── Parameter
```

| Parameter | X | Description |
|-----------|---|-------------|
| Red | 0 | Red channel target intensity |
| Green | 1 | Green channel target intensity |
| Blue | 2 | Blue channel target intensity |
| White | 3 | White channel target intensity |
| Brightness | 4 | Master brightness target |
| Duration | 5 | Fade time in seconds (0=instant) |

### How It Works

1. **Touchscreen sends 6 events**: R, G, B, W, Brightness, Duration
2. **LED controllers store** R, G, B, W, Brightness as pending values
3. **Duration event triggers** the fade from current to pending values
4. **Local interpolation** runs at ~60fps on LED controllers
5. **Minimal bus traffic**: Only 6 events per scene change

### Long Fades (>255 seconds)

For fades exceeding 255 seconds:
- Total duration is divided into equal segments (each ≤255s)
- Intermediate target colors are calculated proportionally
- Example: 5-minute fade = 2 segments of 150s each

This architecture provides smooth, high-fidelity lighting transitions while 
minimizing LCC bus traffic and freeing the touchscreen for UI interaction.

## LCC Configuration (CDI)

The following settings can be configured via any LCC configuration tool (JMRI, etc.):

### User Info (ACDI)
| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| User Name | Node name displayed in LCC tools |
| User Description | Node description displayed in LCC tools |

### Startup Behavior
| Setting | Default | Range | Description |
|---------|---------|-------|--------------|
| Auto-Apply First Scene on Boot | 1 (enabled) | 0-1 | Apply first scene after startup |
| Auto-Apply Transition Duration | 10 seconds | 0-300s | Fade duration for auto-apply |
| Screen Backlight Timeout | 60 seconds | 0, 10-3600s | Idle timeout before screen off (0=disabled) |

### Lighting Configuration
| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Base Event ID | 05.01.01.01.9F.60.00.00 | Base for lighting event IDs |

## User Interface

### Scene Selector Tab (Default)
![Scene selector photo](./docs/img/scene_select_photo.jpg)
- Horizontal swipeable card carousel
- Color preview circle on each card showing approximate light output
- Center-snapping scroll behavior with blue selection highlight
- Transition duration slider (0–300 seconds)
- Apply Button performs smooth linear fade to selected scene
- Progress bar shows fade completion (auto-hides when done)
- Edit button on each card opens edit modal
- Delete button on each card (with confirmation modal)

### Scene Edit Modal

Tap the edit button (✏️) on any scene card to open the edit modal:
![Scene edit photo](./docs/img/scene_edit_photo.jpg)
- **Scene name** text input with on-screen keyboard
- **RGBW + Brightness sliders** (0-255 each) with real-time preview
- **Color preview circle** updates as you adjust values
- **Move Left/Right buttons** to reorder scenes in the carousel
- **Preview button** sends current slider values to lighting for live testing
- **Save** applies changes to SD card, **Cancel** discards

### Manual Control Tab
![Manual control photo](./docs/img/manual_control_photo.jpg)
- Five sliders: Brightness, Red, Green, Blue, White
- **Color preview circle** showing approximate light output from current settings
- **Apply** button sends current values immediately to LCC bus
- **Save Scene** opens dialog to save current settings

### Color Preview Algorithm

The color preview circles approximate the visual output of RGBW LEDs:

- **Additive color mixing**: RGB channels combine as light (R+G=Yellow, etc.)
- **White channel**: Blends color towards white (max 80% at W=255) while preserving hue
- **Brightness**: Acts as intensity using gamma 0.5 curve for perceptual accuracy

### Auto-Apply on Boot

When enabled (default), the device automatically applies the first scene in the
scene list after startup with a configurable fade duration. This allows lights
to smoothly turn on when the layout powers up.

- Configurable via LCC tools (JMRI, etc.)
- Default: Enabled with 10-second transition
- Assumes initial state is all channels at 0 (lights off)

### Power Saving (Screen Timeout)

The screen backlight automatically turns off after a configurable idle period to
save power. Touch the screen to wake it.

- **Configurable timeout**: 0 (disabled), or 10-3600 seconds
- **Default**: 60 seconds
- **Smooth transitions**: 1-second fade-to-black before backlight off, fade-in on wake
- **Touch-to-wake**: Touch during fade or sleep immediately begins wake animation
- **Note**: The backlight is on/off only (not dimmable) due to CH422G I/O expander
  hardware limitation. Fade effect is achieved via LVGL overlay animation.

Configuration via LCC tools (JMRI, etc.):
- Set to 0 to keep screen always on
- Minimum enabled timeout is 10 seconds

### Firmware Updates (OTA)

The device supports over-the-air firmware updates via the LCC Memory Configuration
Protocol. This allows firmware updates through JMRI without physical access to the device.

**Using JMRI:**
1. Connect JMRI to your LCC network
2. Open **LCC Menu → Firmware Update**
3. Select the touchscreen controller by Node ID
4. Choose the firmware file (`build/LCCLightingTouchscreen.bin`)
5. Click "Download" — device reboots automatically when complete

**Safety Features:**
- **Dual OTA partitions**: New firmware written to inactive slot; old firmware preserved
- **Automatic rollback**: If new firmware fails to boot, reverts to previous version
- **Chip validation**: Rejects firmware built for wrong ESP32 variant
- **USB recovery**: Standard USB flashing always available as fallback

**How it works:**
- JMRI sends "Enter Bootloader" command to the device
- Device reboots into bootloader mode with LCD status display
- Screen shows "FIRMWARE UPDATE MODE" header with progress bar
- Firmware is streamed via LCC datagrams to memory space 0xEF
- ESP-IDF OTA APIs write to alternate partition
- On completion, new partition is activated and device reboots
